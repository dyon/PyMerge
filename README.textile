PyMerge is a simple tool to merge virtually unlimited files into one single file.

h2. Configuration

There are some configuration options to allow you to customize the way PyMerge works. These options are stored as key-value pairs.

* *sameDirForMergedFiles:* This setting makes PyMerge override the *destination* setting in each path configuration.
* *mergedFilesPath:* If previous setting is set to True, this is the path where the merged files are going to be stored.
* *pattern*: This is the pattern that PyMerge will search for when finding files to merge. For example, ==*.sql== pattern will find every file whose name ends in .sql.
* *paths:* Array of key-value pairs.
** *source:* The source where PyMerge will find (recursively) for files matching the pattern set in the previous setting.
** *destination:* If *sameDirForMergedFiles* is set to False, the output path where PyMerge will save the merged file.
** *filename:* The name of the output file.
